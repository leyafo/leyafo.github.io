        <h1>Why I learn English so hard</h1>
<p>Chinese is my native language so that writing in Chinese wasn't a struggle as
English for me. But it doesn't mean I can write good Chinese automatically.
To improve my writing skill, I tried to find some books related to how to write
Chinese well, but I gathered nothing. Why Chinese world doesn't have useful
books about writing well? This question had doubted me for a long time until
the beginning of this year when I attended an online Chinese writing course.</p>
<p>The course told us that Chinese is a young language. The Vernacular Language
Movement was established in about 100 years ago, it reformed the Chinese
language - from the ancient style to contemporary Chinese. It made the sentences
easy to read and write. After 1949, China government replaced Traditional
Chinese with Simplified Chinese. So that the Simplified Characters are easier to
write and read than ancient style with Traditional Characters. Moreover,
contemporary Chinese is entirely different from the ancient language. The New
Culture Movement featured many good Chinese writers; for some historical
reasons, they didn't pass their experiences and knowledge to the next
generations. That's why we still don't know how to write good Chinese.</p>
<p>The contemporary Chinese has its benefits. It has a simple grammar system, few
characters can make many different phrases and sentences, which are shorter
than other languages. The pictograph and homograph give the poem tone and
flavor; the abstraction made sentences short. We had a good, sensible
scholarship on intelligentsia that existed in ancient China. For contemporary
Chinese, the scholarship has disappeared. We don't develop a practical way to
learn writing, and it is hard to find a routine method to learn well, even
though you are a Chinese man.</p>
<p>The traditional Chinese culture didn't tell us how things worked, even though
we had Confucian philosophy. The Chinese notion is spreading on its tradition
without inquiry, even though most of them are vulgar practices. We've been
taught that China has 5000 years of history, and it is the greatest culture in
the world. But no one tells us exactly why and how. The fact that we have few
things can be shown off. It's like an advertisement advocating the products, but
they never tell you what the benefits of the products are. They just sound loud
again and again until you trust them.</p>
<p>My Chinese writing teacher told us that good Chinese existed in some government
files. They use a clear, concise and smooth style for propagation. I tried to
read some document files, and I found that the fact was true. But I don't like
the propagative style and hate to distort everything into heroic stanza.
Actually, there are so many emotional texts on the Chinese Internet, they
always attempt to trick you.</p>
<p>In the English world, there are many books and courses that can help me. I can
find an easy curve of path to advance step by step. English has a regular
grammar system and the writing practice is actual and routine. For advancing
writing, I just need to read some classic books and follow the advice to
practice. Although I should devote a lot of time, I don't mind slowly learning.
To learn a second language gives me another eye to see the world. Every culture
has its vulnerability and excellence, I must be humble and keep an open mind
for strange things especially something that was not inside in my native
language.</p>
