        <h1>Pen and paper are the best writing tools</h1>
<p><em>The beginning is always the hardest.</em> This idiom often occurred when you want
to start writing. If you want to be perfect for the beginning, you will put
off the final writing into infinity. Once you started to write the first word,
you will pour the ideas as many as you have.</p>
<p>I tried much software for writing and abandoned many of them.  Typing and
revising in computer are easy, but computer has many distractions to attract
our attentions. The word processor has many powerful features to help us in
obtaining the beautiful format, but the format is not the core of writing.
Write out what you want is the essential purpose in writing.</p>
<p>When we were reading, the text was constructed logically for easy to
understand. But when you are writing, advancing your text are always illogical.
Your brain is powerful and fast, but it figured as a naughty child who
always running indirectly. You should concentrate the mind without any
bothering noises. The errors, the ugly handwriting and the rough sentences can
be fine. You can fix them soon. Writing continually is the first in this
period, thus the writing tools should be simple and has no extra features that
may block the flow off. That's why the plain text editor is good enough and
many famous authors (like George RR Martin) prefer to write on the DOS, or some
command line tools.</p>
<p>Writing through pen and paper seems to be outdate and uneconomic at the present
time. But the pen and paper still have the profit in writing, they are the
simplest tools in the world, they don't need to charge and worked reliable,
they never gave you annoyed notifications, they are so cheap and easy to get.
If you write an incorrect sentence, they wouldn't tell you and blocked your
thinking off. If you want to draw some pictures to improve your thinking, the
pen and paper is simpler than all software. You don't need to concern with the
rough and unfinished drafts, if you satisfy it, publish it; otherwise, you can
burn, break, destroy or drop as your pleasure.</p>
<p>Being patient for the drafts, the completion is better than perfection. It's
difficult to start writing, using the pen for free writing in the paper
can produce the draft quickly. No drafts, no final works, we should work as a
painter, producing the enough drafts, the best work will have been appeared
automatically.</p>
