        <h1>How to build an interrogative sentence</h1>
<p>An interrogative sentence end with a question mark(?) and has the inverted order. There are two kinds of interrogative sentences, the one is expected an answer with details, the other is expected an answer start with Yes/No. This post will describe the differences between them.</p>
<h2>Open-ended question</h2>
<p>An open-ended question cannot be answered with a simple Yes/No. It start with a <strong>wh-</strong> word such as <em>who, when, where, what, how</em>. In spite of this, it expected that you answer the quesiton related the <strong>wh-</strong> word. For example:</p>
<p>Q: What is the reason for your accident?<br />
A: I was driving so fast.</p>
<p>Q: Who has taken my shoes?<br />
A: Your dog held it.</p>
<p>Q: How long is your finger?<br />
A: I don't measure yet.</p>
<p>Sometimes the auxiliary might be ignored, it expected the short answer. For example:</p>
<p>Q: Who wrote &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;?<br />
A: Charles Dickens.</p>
<p>Q: Which team won the champion?<br />
A: Team B.</p>
<p>Q: Which country made many products?<br />
A: China.</p>
<h2>Simple question</h2>
<p>A simple question expected an answer start with Yes/No, it also has inverted order and start with auxiliary or end with auxiliary. It has three kinds of forms.</p>
<h3>1. Starting with auxiliary, the answer still need the auxiliary.</h3>
<p>Q: Are you working at Google?<br />
A: Yes, I am/No I am not.</p>
<p>Q: Does she write the prominent part of this software?<br />
A: Yes, she does/No she doesn't.</p>
<p>Q: Is it a huskey dog?<br />
A: Yes, it is/No it isn't.</p>
<h3>2. Presenting two or more more possible answers in a sentence directly.</h3>
<p>Q: Would you like tee, coffee or water?<br />
A: Water, please.</p>
<p>Q: Would you arrive here by bus or taxi?<br />
A: No, I am walking.</p>
<h3>3. Sometimes we may need to verify our opinions whether it is right or worng, we make the statement in first part and the opposite interrogative in sencond part.</h3>
<p>Q: She is your English teacher, isn't she?<br />
A: Yes she is/No she is not.</p>
<p>Q: You haven't been Japan, have you?<br />
A: Yes, I have/No I haven't.</p>
<p>As you can see, no matter what kind of question sentences, you must invert the auxiliary and subject order. But sometimes when we are writing, we need describe some reasons or facts for something with a signal sentence, we might need a sentence that start with wh- word. In this situation, this kind of sentence is a statement not a question sentence, the wh- word is a adverb. For example:<br />
<strong>Why Apple products are so expensive.</strong><br />
This sentense has the normal order as like the general sentence, we can remove <strong>why</strong> to become a statement sentece.<br />
<strong>Apple products are so expensive.</strong></p>
